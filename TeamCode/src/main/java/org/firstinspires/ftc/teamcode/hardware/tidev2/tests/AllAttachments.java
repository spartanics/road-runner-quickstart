/*
 * This OpMode scans a single servo back and forward until Stop is pressed.
 * The code is structured as a LinearOpMode
 * INCREMENT sets how much to increase/decrease the servo position each cycle
 * CYCLE_MS sets the update period.
 *
 * This code assumes a Servo configured with the name "left_hand" as is found on a Robot.
 *
 * NOTE: When any servo position is set, ALL attached servos are activated, so ensure that any other
 * connected servos are able to move freely before running this test.
 *
 * Use Android Studio to Copy this Class, and Paste it into your team's code folder with a new name.
 * Remove or comment out the @Disabled line to add this OpMode to the Driver Station OpMode list
